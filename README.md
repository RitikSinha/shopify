### Shopify Clone By Ritik Kumar
I cloned Shopify in just 6 hrs with the help of tailwind CSS. 
Last week I cloned Paytm Now It was time to practice Tailwind CSS( mobile-first utility-first CSS framework) 
I tried to create this landing page with the help of tailwind classes.  The challenge I faced during building the project was getting the assets of the project. I took help from chrome dev tools.
